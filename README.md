## Features

A simple Scrum Board inspired by Trello, built with Next.js, TypeScript, Redux Toolkit, Tailwind CSS, and local storage.
-  Three Default Columns: To Do, In Progress, Done
- Add tasks to any column
- Edit and delete tasks
- Drag and drop tasks between columns
- Persist board data in localStorage
- Edit tasks via modal with input
- Filter tasks with real-time search: Implemented with controlled input and filter() over Redux state. Lightweight and reactive way, there is no need for search libraries in a small-scale app.
- Populate board with tasks from public API: Uses Redux createAsyncThunk for fetching and dispatching tasks. Better than fetching directly in components, keeps side effects centralized and testable.
- Accessibility considerations: Custom hooks like useHandleKeys and useOutsideClick + proper role, aria-labelledby, and aria-describedby.
- Add, rename, and delete dynamic columns (except the default ones). Deleted column's tasks move to "To Do": Tracked via Redux with task reassignment logic for deletion.
